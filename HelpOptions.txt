This game is modelled after Windows 98. Navigate the UI as you would on a computer! The start menu, desktop icons, title bars (Minimise, etc), clock and taskbar are all functional!
To change difficulty, mute sound, or change the background, open the Settings program from the desktop or start menu.
There are two difficulties, easy and hard. 
Easy is suited to anyone with a passing knowledge of computers and their history. If you can answer "What company makes the MacBook?", you should do fine!
Hard is more in depth; you'll need to know more about what actually goes on in a computer. If you can answer "Which programming language has the file extension .asm?", you'll be fine!
Further help is available in the game itself, and  the help program is always available if you need it. Thanks for playing!
